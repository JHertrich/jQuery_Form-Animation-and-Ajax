# Javascript / jQuery_Form-Animation and Ajax
 
 Sign Up and Login Form, with jQuery animations.
 Form Validation using a jQuery Validation plugin.
 If form valid, customer data is send to PHP via Ajax.
 PHP connects to a MySQL customer database and checks if email is already taken. If available, the customer data gets inserted into a customer table. Error / success messages are echoed out in the Ajax response and inserted into the DOM via jQuery.
